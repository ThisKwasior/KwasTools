############ platinum_dat_tool

==== Usage:
        To unpack:              platinum_dat_tool.exe <dat file> <options>
        To pack:                platinum_dat_tool.exe <directory> <options>

==== Options:
        Packing and unpacking:
                                  --x360        Process the DAT/folder with Xbox 360 in mind (big endian)
        Packing:
                        --skip_ext_check        Do not get the extension from the folder suffix
						  --do_not_align		Do not align files to 4096 bytes (needed by shader.dat)
						
==== Description:
		First argument is always either a file or a folder, so you can just drag and drop the file/folder on the executable.

		This program does the following:
			- Extracts files from a valid DAT file to a folder with a name in format "<name>_<3-letter-extension>"
			
			- Creates a DAT file from a folder with a name in format "<name>_<3-letter-extension>".
			  When the extension is present, it will append it to a final saved file,
			  otherwise it'll ignore it and default to ".dat" extension.


############ platinum_wta_wtp_tool

==== Usage:
        To unpack:				platinum_wta_wtp_tool.exe file.wta file.wtp
        To pack:				platinum_wta_wtp_tool.exe <directory with DDS files>

==== Options:
        Packing:
                        --skip_ext_check        Do not remove the extension from the folder suffix
						
==== Description:
		First arguments are always either files or a folder, so you can just drag and drop files/folder on the executable.
		File order is determined at runtime, so drag and drop as you like.

		This program does the following:
			- Extracts files from valid WTA/WTP files to a folder with a name in format "<name>_wtp" in the WTP's folder.
			
			- Creates a pair of WTA/WTP files from a folder with a name in format "<name>_<3-letter-extension>".
			  When the extension is present, it will remove it from final saved files,
			  otherwise it'll ignore it and use the entire file name.
		
		File names of extracted DDS files are the Texture ID of the texture in decimal number format (converted from hex to cpu endianness).
		Said Texture ID is used by 3d models (WMB) to locate the correct resource.
		Modify these IDs as you see fit, or add new DDS files with your own IDs.

############ platinum_wtb_tool

==== Usage:
        To unpack:				platinum_wtb_tool.exe file.wtb
        To pack:				platinum_wtb_tool.exe <directory with DDS files>

==== Options:
        Packing:
                        --skip_ext_check        Do not remove the extension from the folder suffix
						
==== Description:
		First argument is always either a file or a folder, so you can just drag and drop the file/folder on the executable.

		This program does the following:
			- Extracts files from valid WTB file to a folder with a name in format "<name>_wtb"
			
			- Creates a WTB file from a folder with a name in format "<name>_<3-letter-extension>".
			  When the extension is present, it will remove it from the final saved file,
			  otherwise it'll ignore it and use the entire file name.

############ platinum_misc_dat2dds2dat

==== Usage:
        To unpack:              platinum_misc_dat2dds2dat.exe <dat files>
        To pack:                platinum_misc_dat2dds2dat.exe <directory with DDS files> <dat files>
						
==== Description:
		A program requested by MGRR Modding community.
		Similar to DTT2DDS, but needs both DAT and DTT to work.
		It also can insert new WTA/WTP/WTB from a folder of DDS files.

		This program does the following:
			- Extracts DDS files from provided DAT and DTT files to a folder in format "<name>_<3-letter-extension>"
			  (extension is either "_wtp" or "_wtb" depending on detected texture archive found in DATs).
			  Order of input files is whatever but it will be looking for WTA/WTP/WTB with a name of the **FIRST** DAT file provided.
			
			- Internally creates a WTA/WTP or WTB file from a folder with a name in format "<name>_<3-letter-extension>" 
			  and inserts it to provided DAT files.
			  The folder name (minus the extension suffix) is being used to locate the correct files to replace.
		
		File names of extracted DDS files are the Texture ID of the texture in decimal number format (converted from hex to cpu endianness).
		Said Texture ID is used by 3d models (WMB) to locate the correct resource.
		Modify these IDs as you see fit, or add new DDS files with your own IDs.
		
		Due to this program being coded in like, an hour, there are probably bugs I don't know about.
		One of these is that it sometimes creates files that won't load correctly in MGRR (talking about ".dat" file here, not ".dtt"),
		but unpacking and repacking ".dat" with platinum_dat_tool fixed the issue for me.
